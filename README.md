An interactive bash script to demonstrate basic Linux commands to kids

## How do I run the script?
The script doesn't need any arguments so run it as any standard bash script

## Do I need any additional materials?
It would be useful to print out the provided fake man pages. 

## Why did you write this?
I give semi-regular talks to schools about my job and what it entails. These are aimed at getting more kids, particularly young girls to consider Linux careers. We are often asked to bring a practical exercise that small groups can work through together in around 15 minutes. 

## Are you accepting pull requests?
